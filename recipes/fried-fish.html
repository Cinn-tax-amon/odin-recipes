        <p>
            Don't let the simplicity of this tasty fried fish recipe fool you: The fillets fry up perfectly cooked inside, with a beautiful golden crust. Haddock and cod are two excellent choices for our fried fish recipe, but tilapia, pollock, catfish, bass, trout, or perch will also yield a beautiful meal. Ready in 30 minutes, this is a perfect meal for a busy weeknight or to serve as a weekend lunch alongside a salad and a few dipping sauces, like classic tartar, Louisiana r√©moulade, or chipotle mayonnaise.
