    <h2>Tips for the Crispiest Fish</h2>
        <p>
            Try these tested tips to get your fish crispy every time:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Always pat dry your fish fillets using paper towels to ensure the flour coating sticks well and there are no soggy parts.</li>
            <li>Once the fish is in the pan, never cover it, as you'll end up steaming it and the coating might fall off, leaving behind a greasy fish fillet.</li>
            <li>Keep the oil temperature steady. A thermometer is a great tool to have at hand, especially if you're fond of fried food.</li>
            <li>Don't move the fish in the pan but allow it to fry and release from the pan naturally.</li>
        </ul>
