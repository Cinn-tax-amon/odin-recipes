<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna (plural “lasagne”) is a flat and expanded 
        pasta sheet, traditionally made in Italy with 
        Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese), Béchamel 
        sauce (white sauce), and ragù (a meat-based sauce). 
        Despite the traditional form still being popular, 
        lasagna has taken on many different recipes over the 
        years.

        Homemade Lasagna is a classic that every cook 
        should have in their rotation. Tender sheets of 
        pasta, a cheese filling, and a rich meaty tomato 
        sauce make the perfect dish!

        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion</li>
        <li>3/4 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>3/4 lb ground italian sausage</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>40 oz marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Lasagna</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>2.5 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Equipment</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>one 9 x 13-inch casserole dish</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<h3>Prep Work</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a
            medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining
            ingredients.
        </li>
    </ol>
<h3>Make The Meat Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat olive oil</strong> over medium heat and <strong>add the diced onions.</strong> Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
        <li><strong>Add the ground beef and sausage</strong> and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. <strong>Add garlic</strong> during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the chicken broth</strong> and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. <strong>Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce.</strong> Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently.</li>
    </ol>
<h3>Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to <strong>375 degrees</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water</strong> for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, <strong>cook the noodles to al dente</strong> according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. <strong>Drain and rinse with cold water</strong> until noodles are completely cool.</li>
        <li>Lay the cooled flat on wax paper while you begin assembling the lasagna</li>
    </ol>
<h3>Assemble</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce</strong> on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, <strong>add 4 lasagna noodles</strong>, overlapping them if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture</strong> over the noodles, followed by about <strong>1 ½ cups of meat sauce.</strong></li>
        <li>Top with <strong>4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.</strong></li>
        <li>Finish with <strong>4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray</strong> and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
